  abstract =	 {In 2003, interests in the Institute of Electronics
                  and Electrical Engineering (IEEE) 802.11 Working
                  Group (WG) led to the formation of Task Group (TG)
                  "S". 802.11s develops a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN)
                  amendment. Unlike existing Mesh products, 802.11s
                  forms a transparent 802 broadcast domain that
                  supports any higher layer protocols. Therefore,
                  802.11s provides frame forwarding and path selection
                  at layer-2. 802.11i describes a security concept for
                  stations that associate with an Access Point
                  (AP). However, in a Mesh Basic Service Set (BSS)
                  devices need to mutually authenticate to provide
                  integrity of the network. Thus, 802.11s adds
                  additional elements to the concepts of 802.11L While
                  traditional Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) are
                  AP centred an 802.11 Mesh is fully
                  distributed. Hence, 802.11s considers extensions to
                  the Medium Access Control (MAC) too. The authors
                  have contributed to the standardization of 802.11s
                  since 2003. As constant participants we give insight
                  to draft 1.02 of TG "s" and provide an outlook to
                  future evolution of 802.11's first Mesh standard.},
